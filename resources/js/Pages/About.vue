                Hello my name is Luke Stevenson, I qualified as a Dance Movement Psychotherapy [DMP] in 2015. My licencing body is the UK Association for Humanistic Psychology Practitioners [UKAHPP] which is an organisational member of Professionals Standards Authority [PSA].
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                Movement Psychotherapy [MP] is a model of work that is somatically informed and as such it engages with the clients body, mind and identity. The aim of MP is to understand that the clients are organic living entities and as such it is more than just the mind which needs to be supported within the psychotherapeutic process to gain a sense of wellness, confidence and to reach their full potential.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                In my work I am highly influenced by Kestenberg Movement profiling [KMP], Body Mind Centring [BMC] and Authentic Movement. These are three areas of continuous study which give me a unique way of supporting the nonverbal process within the therapy space, along with understanding how to engage in beliefs and memories held out of conscious awareness, though exist within their bodily held memories. I feel that creating a space to not only explore from the human societal world, but also to support the re-engagement of the mammalian felt sense of the world we inhabit supports my clients to build a stronger sense of what their individual needs are and how to obtain them.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                In 2016 I moved into a NHS funded project, firstly in a school-based service which focused on supporting young people and their families with the aim of supporting their struggles in the social demands and those who had experienced historic traumas.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                In 2018 I moved over to a specialist trauma service working with clients aged 16+ in a long term capacity. The aim of this was to give a supportive and nurturing environment where, with time, the clients could feel safe enough to explore the historic event(s), and to start to process the memories giving the possibility for them to find some form of freedom from the past.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                The other side of my work that also started in 2018 is a short term crisis service that supports refugees and asylum seekers, 18+ that have newly arrived into the UK. This work is a short intervention that offers psychoeducation, solution focused approach and listening ear. This is a first line of support to help the newly arrived refugees have space to understand and at times explore the PTSD symptoms that they are living with from the event(s) in their home county and/or of the process to finding safety.
