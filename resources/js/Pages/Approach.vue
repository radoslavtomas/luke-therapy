            <p>My style is to work in a creative and person-centered approach to developing a space that is unique for each client and as such fits their individual needs. I work integratively drawing from my experience of being a somatic movement artist, a person-centered therapist and from working in services that secure their funding via Routine Outcome Measures (ROMs) working models. This has given me a wide range of knowledge to draw from to best support my clients. Along with my personal interests and study of KMP, polyvagal theory and transactional analysis. I support my clients to explore the unconscious process of subtle developmental movements which can help them to find new insights on the focus of their therapeutic work.</p>
